# Added Coverage Tool

Today I added a test-coverage tool.

run `mix coverall.html` and open `cover/*html` in your browser.

Unfortunately Phoenix-generator generates weak covered code.
It will be a lot of work to add the missing coverage and I'm not sure
if I'll spend time on this. Maybe I'll find a way to ignore those files
and just trust in Phoenix great work.
